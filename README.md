## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Discord Bot Token (no LLM server needed!)

### 1. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dadv1
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Configure Environment
Edit `.env` with your Discord bot token:
```bash
# Required - Get from https://discord.com/developers/applications
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

**That's it!** No LLM configuration needed.

### 3. Deploy
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The bot will start and sync commands to Discord automatically.

## How Dad Works

### Joke Delivery Flow
1. User types `/dadjoke`
2. Dad types for 1-2 seconds (building anticipation)
3. Dad sends the setup: "I bought some shoes from a drug dealer."
4. Dad types for exactly 2 seconds (suspense!)
5. Dad sends punchline + random GIF: "I don't know what he laced them with, but I was tripping all day!" 
6. After 5 seconds, GIF auto-deletes leaving clean text

### Status Rotation
- Dad's status changes every 10-15 minutes
- 100+ authentic dad activities like:
  - "Watching the grass grow"
  - "Playing hide-and-seek with the remote"
  - "Listening to my own dad jokes"
  - "Streaming a 3-hour documentary about trains"

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Required
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token from Discord Developer Portal

#### Optional
- `LOG_LEVEL=INFO` - Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

### Simple Setup
No LLM server, no rate limits, no complex configuration. Just add your Discord token and deploy!

## Customization

### Adding Dad Jokes

Edit `data/dad_jokes.json` to add more jokes:

```json
{
  "jokes": [
    {
      "setup": "Why don't scientists trust atoms?",
      "punchline": "Because they make up everything!",
      "category": "science"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Available categories:** science, family, food, wordplay, school, sports, tech, work, and more!

### Adding GIFs

1. Add GIF files to `images/gifs/` directory
2. Name them `dad-joke[number].gif` (e.g., `dad-joke7.gif`, `dad-joke8.gif`)
3. Bot automatically finds and uses new GIFs randomly
4. No code changes needed!

### Adding Status Messages

Edit `data/status_updates.json`:

```json
{
  "statuses": [
    "Watching the grass grow",
    "Playing hide-and-seek with the remote",
    "Listening to my own dad jokes"
  ]
}
```

**Format requirements:** Start with Discord activity type (Watching/Playing/Listening/Streaming)

üü¢ Dad
Watching the grass grow

[Someone uses /dadjoke]

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
1. Check bot is online: `./status.sh`
2. Verify Discord permissions: Send Messages, Use Slash Commands, Attach Files
3. Check logs: `./logs.sh errors`
4. Restart if needed: `docker compose restart dad-bot`

### Commands Not Working
1. Ensure slash commands synced: Look for "Synced X slash command(s)" in logs
2. Check Discord permissions for slash commands
3. Try in different channel or DMs

### GIFs Not Showing
1. Verify GIF files exist in `images/gifs/` directory
2. Check file naming: `dad-joke[number].gif`
3. Ensure bot has "Attach Files" permission
4. Check logs for file access errors

### Status Not Updating
1. Verify `data/status_updates.json` exists and is valid
2. Check logs for status rotation messages
3. Status updates every 10-15 minutes (be patient!)
4. Restart bot if status seems stuck

## Performance

### Resource Usage
