## 💡 Additional Notes

### Development Philosophy
Dad was designed with simplicity and reliability in mind. Unlike AI-powered bots that can be unpredictable or expensive, Dad uses static content to ensure consistent, family-friendly interactions that won't surprise server administrators.

### Future Expansion
The static content approach makes Dad easily expandable:
- New jokes can be added to JSON files
- Additional GIFs can be dropped into the images folder
- Status messages can be updated without code changes
- No retraining or complex deployments needed

This makes Dad perfect for communities that want reliable entertainment without ongoing maintenance or surprise behavior changes.
