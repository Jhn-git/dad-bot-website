# Dad Discord Bot Behavior Documentation

This document describes how Dad brings authentic dad personality to Discord servers through static jokes, natural timing, and community engagement.

## Bot Personality

Dad is designed to feel like a real community member rather than an obvious bot. He has:

- **Authentic Dad Energy**: Delivers dad jokes with natural timing and realistic typing simulation
- **Community Presence**: Always active with rotating status messages that change every 10-15 minutes
- **Clean Interactions**: No bot-like command responses cluttering chat history
- **Visual Flair**: GIF animations that auto-delete after 5 seconds for clean message flow

## Dad Joke Delivery System

Dad's signature feature is his natural joke delivery that mimics real conversation patterns.

### How Joke Delivery Works

1. **User triggers**: Someone uses `/dadjoke` or `/dadjoke [category]`
2. **Typing simulation**: Dad shows "typing..." for 1-2 seconds (building anticipation)
3. **Setup delivery**: Dad sends the joke setup (e.g., "I bought some shoes from a drug dealer.")
4. **Suspense pause**: Dad types for exactly 2 seconds (perfect dad timing!)
5. **Punchline + GIF**: Dad delivers punchline with random GIF animation
6. **Clean up**: After 5 seconds, GIF auto-deletes leaving only the text

### Static Joke System

- **No LLM required**: All jokes are pre-written for reliability and speed
- **Categorized collection**: Science, family, food, wordplay, school, sports, tech, work
- **Unlimited usage**: No API costs or rate limits
- **Expandable library**: Easy to add more jokes in `data/dad_jokes.json`

## Status Rotation System

Dad maintains an active presence through rotating status messages.

### How Status Updates Work

- **100+ status messages**: Authentic dad activities like "Watching the grass grow"
- **Automatic rotation**: Changes every 10-15 minutes
- **No repetition**: Never shows the same status twice in a row
- **Discord activities**: Uses "Watching", "Playing", "Listening", "Streaming" formats

### Example Status Messages

- "Watching the grass grow"
- "Playing hide-and-seek with the remote"
- "Listening to my own dad jokes"
- "Streaming a 3-hour documentary about trains"
- "Playing with the thermostat"

## Command System

Dad uses a simple slash command system focused on joke delivery.

### Available Commands

- **`/dadjoke`**: Get a random dad joke from any category
- **`/dadjoke [category]`**: Get a joke from a specific category
- **`/help`**: Show all commands and available joke categories

### Command Categories

- **General Commands**: All users can access joke commands
- **No Admin Commands**: Dad is designed to be maintenance-free
- **No Premium Features**: All functionality is free and unlimited

## Technical Architecture

### Static Content System

- **Pre-written jokes**: Stored in `data/dad_jokes.json`
- **Status messages**: Stored in `data/status_updates.json`  
- **GIF library**: Files in `images/gifs/` directory
- **No external APIs**: Completely self-contained

### Performance Characteristics

- **Very lightweight**: No LLM processing overhead
- **Fast responses**: No network calls or AI processing delays
- **Low memory usage**: Simple static content storage
- **High scalability**: Can serve multiple servers without performance impact

## Error Handling System

Dad is designed for reliability with minimal error scenarios:

- **File access errors**: Graceful fallback if joke files are missing
- **GIF errors**: Still delivers text if GIF files are unavailable
- **Discord API errors**: Retry logic for message delivery
- **Status update errors**: Continues joke functionality if status updates fail

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- **`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`**: Required Discord bot token
- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: Optional logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

### No Complex Configuration

Dad is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal setup:
- No LLM server configuration
- No database setup required
- No external API keys needed
- No per-server customization needed

## Content Management

      "punchline": "Because they make up everything!",
      "category": "science"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding New GIFs

1. Add GIF files to `images/gifs/` directory
